This method is valid for any MEMCM/SCCM application. In this case I will use the configuration manager client upgrade application. You might ask yourself, why not use the automatic client upgrade? Well, because the client upgrade can only run during a maintenance window. I won‚Äôt go into details, but unless this behavior changes, I cannot use this feature with my current environment.

Without further ado, here is how to do it‚Ä¶

## Create the Application

I wanted to make this as simple as possible so I don‚Äôt have to tinker with it every time there‚Äôs a new update.

### Set the configuration manager application version

The version will be used by the discovery method, make sure you use the correct one.

### Set the application source

This path will remain the same, so there is no need to touch this ever again.

`<ConfigMgrServer>\<ConfigMgrPath>\Client`

### Create the installation script

In order to be able to specify the local installation source we need to use a script. Useful in low bandwidth environments.

### Set the discovery method

<script src="https://embed.cacher.io/d0566d835960fe16ada9419b0c2848af2c0faa47.js?a=416f41347cef57be422b9dbaadfadb76&t=github_gist"></script>

> **Notes**
> Remember to change the application name accordingly.

### Set the Install String

```powershell
Powershell.exe -File Install-CMClient.ps1 -ExecutionPolicy ‚ÄòBypass‚Äô -WindowStyle ‚ÄòHidden‚Äô
```

### Set the uninstall string

```cmd
CCMSETUP.EXE /Uninstall
```

## Deploy the application

The only thing to do now is to deploy the newly created application. If a new version of the client becomes available you just need to change the application version and update the content.

> **Notes**
> The production version of the configuration manager client is always used, so make sure you promote the pilot to production if you want to use the latest version.
