[Report release history](https://SCCM.Zone/SW-SQL-Server-Products-CHANGELOG)

[Previous report version](https://sccm-zone.com/sql-version-detection-and-report-sccm-2012-r2-12f299b5e63b)

[Originaly published on sccmf12twice.com](https://SCCM.Zone/SW-SQL-Server-Products-EXT)

This is the second iteration of my SQL version report. When I look back on my previous work I always cringe and this was no exception. A while back, I received a request to add the SQL key to the report, so I began examining the old code. Horrified by the things that I found laying dormant there, I scrapped everything and started anew. The result is a brand new report with a lot more info, smaller database footprint and much better coding.

## Recommendations

* Do not modify or remove the previous extension version until you thoroughly test the new version.
* Use a test environment for validation!
* Back-up your [configuration.mof](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb680858.aspx) file before any changes!
* Use [mofcomp.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/mofcomp) to validate the [configuration.mof](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb680858.aspx) on a test machine first!

> **Notes**
> This version is compatible with the previous version, they can live side by side.
> Hardware inventory extension needs to be done on the top of your hierarchy.
> **Allow** some time for the policy to be downloaded or force a policy refresh.
> **Allow** some time for the data to be gathered or force a HWI collection.
> This report was created with SQL 2017 Reporting Services, you might need to remove some report elements if you use an older version.

## Prerequisites

* Test environment
* Downloads (Right click → Download linked file)
  * [HWI EXT SQL Server Products.mof](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCCM-Zone/sccm-zone.github.io/master/Reporting/Software/SW%20SQL%20Server%20Products/HWI%20EXT%20SQL%20Server%20Products.mof) (HWI Extension)
  * [HWI DEF SQL Server Products.mof](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCCM-Zone/sccm-zone.github.io/master/Reporting/Software/SW%20SQL%20Server%20Products/HWI%20DEF%20SQL%20Server%20Products.mof) (HWI Definitions)
  * [SW SQL Server Products.rdl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCCM-Zone/sccm-zone.github.io/master/Reporting/Software/SW%20SQL%20Server%20Products/SW%20SQL%20Server%20Products.rdl) (SSRS Report)
* Create SQL Stored Procedure (Copy/Paste → SSMS)
  * [usp_PivotWithDynamicColumns](#sql-stored-procedure)

## Installation

### HWI Extension

The extension needs to be added to the `<CMInstallLocation>\Inboxes\clifiles.src\hinv\configuration.mof` file

* Insert the extension at the end of the `configuration.mof` file between the following headers:

```text
//========================
// Added extensions start
//========================

//========================
// Added extensions end
//========================
```

* Uncomment the `Old SQL extension cleanup` section to remove the old extension classes from the clients repositories if needed.
* Use a test environment for validation as described in the [Test and Validation](#test-and-validation) section.

> **Notes**
> Always use a test environment before any changes in production!
> Never create any extensions outside of the `Added extensions start/end` headers.
> Try to have consistent formatting inside these headers.
> Never modify anything outside these headers.
> Watch for other previous extensions and use clear delimitations between them.

### Apply changes

Compiling the configuration.mof file in the hinv folder on the CAS/PSS, will trigger the distribution and compilation on all machines in your environment on the next machine policy evaluation.

```cmd
mofcomp.exe <CMInstallLocation>\Inboxes\clifiles.src\hinv\Configuration.mof
```

    caption="Compile the configuration.mof file" alt="Apply changes by compiling the configuration.mof file" caption-position="bottom" caption-effect="slide"
>}}

### HWI Definitions

You need to add the new class definitions to the Default Client Settings

* Import definitions.

    caption="Make sure the new extension classes are enabled and click 'OK'"
    caption-position="bottom" caption-effect="slide"
>}}

&nbsp;

> **Notes**
> DO NOT DELETE the old extension definitions if you still want to use the old report!

## Test and Validation

### Configuration.mof

Use `mofcomp.exe` to check if `configuration.mof` was correctly modified and implement the changes.

```powershell
## Check syntax
mofcomp.exe -check <Configuration.mof_Directory>\Configuration.mof

## Compile file
/*
Compiling the configuration.mof file in the hinv folder on the CAS/PSS,
will trigger the distribution and compilation on all machines in your
environment on the next machine policy evaluation.
*/

mofcomp.exe <Configuration.mof_Directory>\Configuration.mof
```

{{<
    beautifulfigure src="/uploads/posts/2019/pwsh-mofcomp-check_and_compile_configuration.mof.png"
    caption="Compiling the configuration.mof is done on a test environment here!"
    caption-position="bottom" caption-effect="slide"
>}}

&nbsp;

> **Notes**
> Saving and compiling the configuration.mof file in the hinv folder on the CAS/PSS, will trigger the distribution and compilation on all machines in your environment on the next machine policy evaluation.

### WMI

Use PowerShell to check if the new classes have been created in WMI

```powershell
## Check if the new classes are present in WMI
/* The machine must have at least one version of SQL installed in
order for these classes to be created */

#  Get SQL 2017 class
Get-CimClass -ClassName SQL_2017_Property

#  Get SQL 2014 class
Get-CimClass -ClassName SQL_2014_Property

#  Get SQL 2012 class
Get-CimClass -ClassName SQL_2012_Property

#  Get SQL 2008 class
Get-CimClass -ClassName SQL_2008_Property

#  Get SQL Legacy class
Get-CimClass -ClassName SQL_Legacy_Property

#  Get SQL ProductID class
Get-CimClass -ClassName SQL_ProductID
```

### Database

Use SSMS (SQL Server Management Studio) to check if the views are created in the CM database

{{<
    beautifulfigure src="/uploads/posts/2019/DB-hwi_sql_extension_views.png"
    caption="CMDB extension views"
    caption-position="bottom" caption-effect="slide"
>}}

## Import the SSRS Report

### Upload Report to SSRS

* Start Internet Explorer and navigate to [http://&lt;YOUR_REPORT_SERVER_FQDN&gt;Reports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)
* Choose a path and upload the previously downloaded report file.

### Configure Imported Report

* [Replace the DataSource](https://joshheffner.com/how-to-import-additional-software-update-reports-in-sccm/) in the report.

## Create the SQL Stored Procedure

The `usp_PivotWithDynamicColumns` is needed in order to maximize code reuse and have a more sane and sanitized data source.

* Copy paste the [usp_PivotWithDynamicColumns](#sql-stored-procedure) in SSMS
* Change the `<SITE_CODE>` in the `USE` statement to match your Site Code.
* Click `Execute` to add the `usp_PivotWithDynamicColumns` stored procedure to your database.

> You might need additional DB access to install the support function!
