[Report release history](https://SCCM.Zone/DE-Deployments-by-Device-or-User-CHANGELOG)

No default reports exists that can display results for each collection member. There is a report that lists deployments for a specific collection but that‚Äôs it. If a collection member has a deployment on a different collection you are out of luck. Well not anymore‚Ä¶

I used the [`All package and program deployments`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sccm/core/servers/manage/list-of-reports#software-distribution---package-and-program-deployment) to a specified user/device as reference. One of the problems was that the `User` report has a bug and returns `NULL` for most packages. Since the views are so well documented, it took a while to get it right.

## Prerequisites

* Report (Follow link ‚Üí Copy/Download)
  * [DE Software Deployments by Device or User.rdl](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/a8c54490242f96c2f43a)

## Installation

### Upload Report to SSRS
