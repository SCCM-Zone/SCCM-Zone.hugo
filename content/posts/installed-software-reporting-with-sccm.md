[Report release history](http://SCCM.Zone/sw-installed-software-by-user-selection-changelog)

Most software reports out there are pretty basic so I decided to build something new. The idea was to allow filtering by multiple software names and SQL wildcards. This principle applies to both inclusions and exclusions. The only drawback is that you have to use a SQL string parser for splitting the CSV strings. There is no need to re-invent the wheel, you can use the one created by [`Michelle Ufford`](http://hadoopsie.com).

At first, I built two reports, one displaying the data by device name and the other by publisher. In the end I ended up by merging them since it does not make sense to have to maintain two reports using the same query.

Also I‚Äôve updated my report template since the old one was an over-designed pile of c**p, too hard to maintain and to reuse. My other reports will also get the upgrade in time.

> **Notes**
> The reports have two data sources since my CM DB in on a HA cluster. I need access to the ReportServer DB to get the report description in the `ReportDescription` dataset, so feel free to switch to one dataset.

## Prerequisites

* Report (Follow link ‚Üí Download)
  * [SW Installed Software by User Selection.rdl](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/a948fe20b2fbc9ec1062)
* Create SQL User Function (Follow link ‚Üí Copy/Paste ‚Üí [`SSMS`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017))
  * [ufn_csv_String_Parser.sql](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/22b47fd513bfb97f3dd5) (String Parser)

## Import the SSRS Report

### Upload Report to SSRS

* Start Internet Explorer and navigate to [`http://<YOUR_REPORT_SERVER_FQDN>/Reports`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)
* Choose a path and upload the previously downloaded report file.

### Configure Imported Report

* Replace the [`DataSource`](https://joshheffner.com/how-to-import-additional-software-update-reports-in-sccm/) in the report.

## Create the SQL User Function

The [`ufn_csv_String_Parser`](#sql-user-function) is needed in order to split the imput strings.

* Copy paste the [`ufn_csv_String_Parser`](#sql-user-function) in [`SSMS`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)
* Change the `<SITE_CODE>` in the `USE` statement to match your Site Code.
* Click `Execute` to add the [`ufn_csv_String_Parser`](#sql-user-function) user function to your database.

> **Notes**
> You might need additional DB access to install the support function!
