[Report release history](https://SCCM.Zone/SIT-Maintenance-Windows-CHANGELOG)

There comes a time when you need to cleanup or view all maintenance windows for your environment. I had this for a while but realized only today that there is no builtin report that can show you all maintenance windows in SCCM. Without further ado‚Ä¶

## Prerequisites

* Report (Follow link ‚Üí Download)
  * [SIT Maintenance Windows by Collection and Type.rdl](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/d049710063b6115d8747)

## Installation

### Upload Report to SSRS

* Start Internet Explorer and navigate to [`http://<YOUR_REPORT_SERVER_FQDN>/Reports`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name)
* Choose a path and upload the previously downloaded report file.

> **Notes**
> This report was created with SQL 2014 Reporting Services, you might need to remove some report elements if you use an older version.

### Configure Imported Report

* Replace the [`DataSource`](https://joshheffner.com/how-to-import-additional-software-update-reports-in-sccm/) in the report.
